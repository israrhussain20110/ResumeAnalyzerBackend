# ResumeAnalyzerBackend

ResumeAnalyzerBackend is a Python-based backend service designed to analyze resumes and extract valuable information for recruitment or HR processes. This repository provides the foundational backend logic to parse, evaluate, and manage resume data efficiently.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Automatically extract key information (skills, experience, education, etc.) from resumes.
- **Skill Matching:** Match candidate profiles to job descriptions based on required skills.
- **RESTful API:** Expose endpoints for integrating with front-end applications or third-party services.
- **Data Storage:** Store and retrieve parsed resume data.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new analyzers or improve parsing logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- (Optional) [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for isolated development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/israrhussain20110/ResumeAnalyzerBackend.git
   cd ResumeAnalyzerBackend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```
*(Replace `app.py` with the entry point of your application if different.)*

The backend will start on the default port (typically 5000 or as configured).

## API Documentation

The backend provides RESTful endpoints for resume analysis. Example endpoints might include:

- `POST /api/parse`: Upload and parse a resume file.
- `GET /api/resumes`: List parsed resumes.
- `GET /api/resumes/<id>`: Retrieve details of a specific resume.
- `POST /api/match`: Match a resume to job requirements.

For detailed API usage, see the [`docs/`](docs/) directory or Swagger/OpenAPI specification if provided.
